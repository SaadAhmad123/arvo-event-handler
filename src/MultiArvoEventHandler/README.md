The main differences between `MultiArvoEventHandler` and `ArvoEventHandler` are:

1. Contract Binding:
   - `ArvoEventHandler` is bound to a specific `ArvoContract` and handles events of a single type defined by that contract.
   - `MultiArvoEventHandler` is not bound to any specific contract and can handle multiple event types.

2. Event Validation:
   - `ArvoEventHandler` validates incoming events against the contract it's bound to.
   - `MultiArvoEventHandler` doesn't perform any built-in validation, leaving it up to the handler implementation.

3. Event Creation:
   - `ArvoEventHandler` uses an event factory created from its bound contract to create output events.
   - `MultiArvoEventHandler` uses a generic `createArvoEvent` function to create output events.

4. Flexibility:
   - `ArvoEventHandler` is more structured and type-safe due to its contract binding.
   - `MultiArvoEventHandler` is more flexible and can be used in scenarios where you need to handle various event types that might not conform to a single contract.

5. Use Case:
   - `ArvoEventHandler` is ideal for scenarios where you have well-defined contracts and want to ensure type safety and validation.
   - `MultiArvoEventHandler` is suitable for more general-purpose event handling, where you might need to process various event types without the constraints of a specific contract.

Both handlers share similar telemetry and error handling mechanisms, but `MultiArvoEventHandler` provides more flexibility at the cost of some type safety and built-in validation.
